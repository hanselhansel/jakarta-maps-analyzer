# Google Maps API Key Diagnosis and Solution

## Current Status: ❌ ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### Problem Summary
The Google Maps API key exists and has correct format, but the Google Cloud project is not authorized to use the required APIs.

**Error Message**: `REQUEST_DENIED (This API project is not authorized to use this API.)`

### Root Cause Analysis

#### ✅ What's Working
1. **API Key Format**: Correct (39 characters, starts with 'AIza')
2. **API Key Loading**: All scripts use identical, correct method:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()
   api_key = os.getenv('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY')
   ```
3. **Environment File**: `.env` file exists with API key
4. **Previous Success**: The API worked before (evidenced by `api_debug_response.json`)

#### ❌ What's Not Working
- **API Authorization**: The Google Cloud project associated with this API key is missing required API enablements

### Required APIs That Need to be Enabled

Based on the code analysis, these APIs must be enabled in your Google Cloud Console:

1. **Places API** - Used by:
   - `gmaps.places_nearby()` calls in all scripts
   - `gmaps.place()` calls for detailed information

2. **Geocoding API** - Used by:
   - `gmaps.geocode()` calls in test scripts
   - General location resolution

## 🔧 SOLUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Enable Required APIs in Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (the one associated with your API key)
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
4. Search for and enable these APIs:
   - **Places API**
   - **Geocoding API**
   - **Maps JavaScript API** (if you plan to use web interfaces)

### Step 2: Verify API Key Restrictions (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click on your API key
3. Under "API restrictions":
   - Either select "Don't restrict key" (for testing)
   - Or specifically allow: Places API, Geocoding API

### Step 3: Test the Fix

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python3 test_api_key.py
```

Expected output after fix:
```
✓ Geocoding test passed - Jakarta coordinates: -6.2088, 106.8456
✓ Places search test passed - Found X restaurants
✓ Your API key is working correctly
```

### Step 4: Run Community Extractor

After APIs are enabled, run:
```bash
python3 community_extractor.py
```

## 📊 Code Analysis Summary

### API Key Loading Consistency ✅
All scripts use the exact same, correct method:

**main.py (working method):**
```python
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY')
```

**community_extractor.py (same method):**
```python
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY')
```

**No differences found** - the loading mechanism is identical and correct.

### API Calls Made by Scripts

1. **Places Nearby Search**: `gmaps.places_nearby()`
   - Requires: **Places API**
   - Used by all data collection scripts

2. **Place Details**: `gmaps.place()`
   - Requires: **Places API** 
   - Used to get detailed business information

3. **Geocoding**: `gmaps.geocode()` 
   - Requires: **Geocoding API**
   - Used by test scripts and location resolution

## 💡 Why This Happened

The API key was working previously (evidenced by successful data collection of 2,350 records), but the APIs may have been:
- Disabled in the Google Cloud project
- Expired trial period ended
- Billing account issues
- Project configuration changes

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Immediately**: Enable Places API and Geocoding API in Google Cloud Console
2. **Verify**: Run `python3 test_api_key.py`
3. **Proceed**: Run `python3 community_extractor.py` once APIs are enabled
4. **Monitor**: Check Google Cloud Console for API usage and billing

## 📈 Expected Results After Fix

- Test script should pass all checks
- Community extractor should start finding places in Jakarta
- No more "REQUEST_DENIED" errors
- API usage will appear in Google Cloud Console
